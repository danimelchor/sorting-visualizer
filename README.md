# Sorting Visualizer

## Introduction

Welcome! This is the respository for this [sorting visualizer](https://danimelchor.github.io/sorting-visualizer/). This project was made during my freshman year in college to explain to my friends how each of the algorithms we were taught worked. Reducing the animation speed will definitely help you understand these algorithms much easier. If you want to see them in action with bigger datasets, I recommend disabling the animations so they run faster.

## Code

This project is coded in JavaScript using JQuery. Even though this is clearly not the fastest library it was very useful to display real time animations using the [css method](https://api.jquery.com/css/) and [async functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function).

## Contribution

This project is partly based on [this](https://github.com/mahfuzrifat7/SortingVisualizer) project by mahfuzrifat7. I saw several issues with his project such as not enough control over the ammount of bars/animation speed.
